    "1) Problem statement.\n",
    "\"Trips & Travel.Com\" company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base. One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages. Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering * Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information. The company is now planning to launch a new product i.e. Wellness Tourism Package. Wellness Tourism is defined as Travel that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance or kick-start a healthy lifestyle, and support or increase one's sense of well-being. However, this time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Data Collection.\n",
    "The Dataset is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/susant4learning/holiday-package-purchase-prediction The data consists of 20 column and 4888 rows."

    "Explanation: In Python, None is a special constant that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It's commonly used in data structures to indicate missing or non-existent data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation: This term generally refers to any data point that is absent in the dataset. It can be represented by various placeholders (like NaN, N/A, etc.) and needs to be addressed during data cleaning.\n",
    "Empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: An empty value often refers to a string or a data entry that has no content (e.g., \"\"). It's important to identify and handle empty values as they can affect data analysis and processing.\n",
    "Outlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations in a dataset. It may indicate variability in the measurements or might suggest a data entry error. Identifying and treating outliers is crucial during data cleaning.\n",
    "Duplicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Duplicate records occur when the same data entry appears more than once in a dataset. These can skew analysis results and should be identified and removed.\n",
    "Standardization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: This refers to the process of bringing different data formats or values into a common format. For example, dates might be standardized to a single format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
    "Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Normalization involves adjusting values in a dataset to a common scale, often used for numerical data to improve model performance in machine learning. This can include min-max scaling or z-score normalization."

    "One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can process. Categorical data refers to data that can take on a limited number of distinct values, such as colors (red, blue, green) or categories (cat, dog, bird).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "For each category, one-hot encoding creates a binary (0 or 1) vector where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0.\n",
    "For example, if you have a column with three categories: \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" one-hot encoding will represent this as:\n",
    "Red: [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Green: [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "Blue: [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "One-hot encoding is used when categorical data doesn’t have an inherent ordinal relationship, like in the case of colors, types of animals, or brands. It ensures that the machine learning algorithm doesn't treat these categorical values as ordinal or numeric in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact:\n",
    "One-hot encoding increases the dimensionality of the dataset, but it helps the model correctly interpret the categorical values. It prevents models from assuming any sort of priority or ranking in categorical variables, which could distort results in tasks like classification."

    "Explanation:\n",
    "The StandardScaler is used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. In essence, it transforms the data in such a way that the mean becomes 0, and the standard deviation becomes 1 for each feature.\n",

    "μ is the mean of the feature,\n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "σ is the standard deviation of the feature.\n",
    "After transformation, the data will have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "StandardScaler is useful when features have different units or scales (e.g., age vs. income). If the scale of features varies widely, it can distort the performance of machine learning models like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression,\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM),\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),\n",
    "Gradient Descent-based algorithms (like Neural Networks).\n",
    "For instance, if a dataset has both \"age\" (ranging from 0 to 100) and \"salary\" (ranging from 20,000 to 200,000), salary would dominate due to its larger scale. Standardization ensures all features are treated equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact:\n",
    "It makes algorithms converge faster in optimization problems.\n",
    "It improves model performance, especially in algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales, like SVMs, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
    "For distance-based algorithms (like k-NN), it ensures that no single feature dominates the distance calculation.\n"
